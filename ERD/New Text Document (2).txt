Drawing the ER Diagram
Entities: Draw rectangles for each entity (Student, Branch, Track, Intake, Department, Instructor, Course, Question, Exam, StudentAnswer, ExamQuestion).

Relationships: Draw diamonds to represent relationships. Connect each entity to its respective relationships using lines.

Cardinality:

For one-to-many relationships, place a '1' near the one side and an 'N' (or 'M') near the many side.
For many-to-many relationships, use 'N' on both sides.
